									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>

                  <p>I was born in a Chicago suburb, where I lived until I was 11. My father was transferred to the east coast and my family moved to western Connecticut. While there, I completed my public education, received my bachelors from Western Connecticut State University, soon after acquired a masters degree from Fordham University.</p>

                  <p>In my late twenties, I moved to Providence, Rhode Island where I live now</p>
								
									<h3 class="major">About My Work</h3>

                  <p>My employment experience has been vast and varied. I began my first career as a clinical social worker specializing in mental health care. After many years of experience, I needed a change. 
                    
                  My parents, and especially my father, inspired my appreciation of history; I developed an appreciation for architecture history in general, and historic architectural restoration specifically. I spent many years involved with historic restoration. Later, I obtained a real estate license and specialized in sale of historic residential property.</p>

									<p>When the real estate market crashed in the early 2000's, I took a part-time job in retail to make ends meet. Eventually, I was offered full time employment and became a customer service manager, and remained in this position for a number of years. Given the lack of mobility and relatively low pay, I moved on.</p>

                  <p>Throughout all of my employment experience I had a proficiency for working with computers, primarily focused on using software to enhance my job performance. I developed data-bases, tracked data, identify trends, and used the data to create efficient work-flows, and ensure compliance with performance objectives.</p>

									<p>After the sale of personal real estate, I had an opportunity to make another career change and persued my interest in working with computers. I left my job, lived off my savings, and began to educate myself about coding and web-design. I decided to focus on becoming a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp">full stack web-developer.</a></p>

                  <p>It was a difficult road, but not for obvious reasons. After several months of success with online tutorials (there are several excellent ones that are free of charge, and others of equal quality at low cost), I found it difficult to pull all that I had learned together. I found an online resource of experts with whom I consulted to further my knowledge.</p>

                  <p>After a few disappointing experiences, I was very fortunate. I found a teacher, a mentor who opened the door for me. He was highly skilled as an instructor. I was fortunate to have connected with him. What I learned from him was invaluable. He facilitated my learning. I am grateful for what he taught me, and what I learned. His knowledge and experience are exceptional. Our work together lead to the creation of several projects, each incorporating technology as I learned it. I was also encouraged to utilize my creativity. 
                    
                  My mentor, always aware of the most current technological developments, encouraged me to use them. I was able to do so, and incorporated some of what I learned into a number of relatively simple projects that helped me to learn the foundational components of back-end development, coding and web-design.</p>
                  
                  <p>In addition, I learned about many online resources for web-development - always at the edge of technological development. Some of the technology and resources he shared were utilized in creating my projects.</p>

                  <p>The following link will bring you to a closer look at some of my work: (include link)</p>

                  <p>For those interested in exploring a career in this field, I have included some of the resources I used below. I found these to be above others in general. I do not benefit from endorsing them in anyway. I'm simply sharing what and how I learned, honestly and openly. At the same time, I encourage you to explore any and all opportunities to find what works for you. </p>
